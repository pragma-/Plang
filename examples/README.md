# Examples
These are some test examples to demonstrate what Plang is capable of so far.

It's not much. Yet. There are some more examples in [the unit test script.](../test/unit_tests.pl)

You can run each script from the parent directory with:

    $ ./plang < examples/<script.pl>

## examples.pl
A brief introduction to syntax that is somewhat unique to Plang.

## fibonacci.pl
Prints the first 15 fibonacci numbers.
